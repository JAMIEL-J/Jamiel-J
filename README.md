## Hloo I'm Jamiel

**Applied AI Engineer | Data Scientist | Analytics Engineer**

I build **end-to-end data and AI systems** — from raw data and models to deployable applications and decision-ready dashboards.
My work spans **analytics, machine learning, and generative AI**, with a strong emphasis on **practical deployment, system design, and business relevance**.

I don’t treat analytics, ML, or LLMs as isolated experiments. I build **usable systems**.

---

## What I Do (Role Clarity)

* Design and implement **analytics pipelines** that support real business decisions
* Build **machine learning models** and expose them through web applications
* Develop **LLM and GenAI-based systems**, including multi-agent workflows
* Translate ambiguous problems into **structured, measurable solutions**

If it can’t be explained, deployed, or evaluated — it’s not finished.

## Technical Focus Areas

### Data Analytics & Business Intelligence

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* KPI definition & performance tracking
* Customer segmentation, churn & retention analysis
* Executive-ready dashboards and reports

### Machine Learning & Predictive Systems

* Regression & classification models
* Feature engineering and preprocessing
* Model evaluation and optimization
* Practical ML with production awareness

### Generative AI & LLM Systems

* LLM-powered applications and workflows
* Prompt engineering and structured outputs
* Multi-agent research systems
* API-based GenAI integration (Gemini)

### Engineering & Tools

* **Python**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
* **SQL**: analytical querying & transformations
* **Web Apps**: Streamlit (ML & AI interfaces)
* **Visualization**: Power BI, Matplotlib
* **Pipelines**: ETL, Power Query, modular workflows

I prioritize **maintainability, clarity, and reuse** over clever shortcuts.

## Representative Projects

### Smart Rent Predictor (ML Web App)

* Built using **TensorFlow + Streamlit**
* Predicts rental prices using structured features
* Demonstrates the full ML lifecycle: data → model → deployment

This is applied ML, not a notebook-only demo.

---

### Multi-Agent Research System (GenAI)

* Built using **Gemini API**
* Implements multi-agent task decomposition and synthesis
* Explores coordinated LLM reasoning beyond single-prompt usage

Focused on system behavior, not prompt tricks.

---

### Analytics & BI Dashboards

* Modular, performance-aware dashboards
* Clear metric logic and KPI ownership
* Designed for stakeholders, not analysts only

Every visualization serves a decision.

---

## What You’ll Find in This GitHub

* End-to-end **analytics, ML, and GenAI projects**
* Deployable web apps, not isolated scripts
* Clean Python utilities and data pipelines
* Documentation that explains **design choices and trade-offs**

This is a **working portfolio**, not a project dump.

---

## Current Focus

* Building **LLM-based systems** beyond chat interfaces
* Improving **robustness and UX** of ML-powered web apps
* Designing analytics systems that scale past demos
* Aligning work toward **Applied AI / ML Engineer roles**

---

## Working Philosophy

> Good systems reduce confusion.
> Great systems reduce decision cost.

Models and dashboards are tools.
The outcome is **clarity, leverage, and trust**.
